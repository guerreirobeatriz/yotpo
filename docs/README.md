# Yotpo Reviews Integration

The Yotpo Reviews Integration app is a product review and rating integration with [Yotpo](https://www.yotpo.com/).

## Configuration

1. [Install](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/store/installing-an-app) the `yotpo` app in the desired account;
2. In the admin's account, access **Apps** and then select the **Yotpo Integration** box;

3. Once in the app's page, define the appâ€™s configurations in the **setup** section:

- **Yotpo App Key**: Enter the app key that you have received from Yotpo's admin interface.

 :warning: This app fills the standard VTEX review blocks with content using abstract interfaces from  `vtex.product-review-interfaces` . The **VTEX review blocks** are:

- `"product-reviews"`: This block can be added to the product page (`store.product`). It renders the main Yotpo widget which lists any reviews or answered questions for the product being viewed as well as a form to add a new review or ask a new question.

- `"product-rating-summary"`: This block can be added to the product page (`store.product`) and renders the average rating for the product being viewed as well as the number of reviews that have been submitted. 

- `"product-rating-inline"`: Similar to the previous block, but intended to be used in product shelves. 

This app also includes a pixel integration to send order conversation tracking data to Yotpo.

## Customization 

In order to apply CSS customizations in this and other blocks, follow the instructions given in the recipe on [Using CSS Handles for store customization](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/style/using-css-handles-for-store-customization).
